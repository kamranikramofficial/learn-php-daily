                            <p>Hello! I'm Kamran, a student of Class 10 at Alberuni Education System 📚. My
                                father's name is Muhammad Ikram 👨‍👧. I'm excited to share that I recently programmed
                                an ESP8266 🌐 and turned it into a Wi-Fi jammer ⚡. It was an incredible experience to
                                work on such an innovative project 💡, and I'm proud of how much I learned from it! 🚀".

                                jammer include:
